This project is based on data analysis.

Major use of this project was to analyze the huge data coming from the admission process. 
Different students from different universities take admission into a particular college, due to lack of proper graphical data it is quite difficult to draw a conclusion regarding student migration. Scrutiny Probe is a Python based application which analyzes the data and outputs pie-charts displaying migration of data(i.e how many students entered Pune university with different home university).

Application also outputs pie-chart displaying merit analysis. Highest merit student opts for which department and belongs to which category. It also analyzes male to female ratio of admission for 7 departments of college.

Technology: Python
